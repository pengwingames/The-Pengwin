# Welcome to the home of The Pengwin!

### Path of Exile Synthesis league giveaway

*I've already run this by GGG support*

**Who am I? The Pengwin** [twitch.tv/the_pengwin](www.twitch.tv/the_pengwin), a small fly on the wall streamer who has been around games for his entire life. I only have about ~550 hours in path so I'd describe myself as a semi-hardcore-casual-enthusiast. Gaming is a passion and depending on the reception of this giveaway I may do this for future leagues to come! I plan to stream all sorts of games, so my content is not strictly PoE related. Feel free to shout out helpful tips or point out how terrible I am compared to your other favorite streamers!


**THE PRIZES:**

**2x $30 Sunstone supporter packs codes**

**1x $30 Doomcrow supporter pack code**

**X additional supporter pack codes determined during the stream.**

There will be additional prizes offered depending on how many subscribers I get during the stream, but will be handed out at a future time whenever GGG can process the order for me. The codes will be redeemable through https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/redeem-key.



**THE FORMAT:**

Starting at league launch(3/8/19 Noon PST) I will do a 12+ hour stream. The giveaways will be at ~4/8/12 hours from league start, with the guaranteed prizes in order of Sunstone/Doomcrow/Sunstone pack codes. There will be a timer on my stream counting towards each giveaway. The additional prize giveaways will be (1) more supporter pack per (15) subscribers I get during each 4 hour window. **Subscribers will have a 4x more likely chance of winning any, as they will be contributing towards the additional prizes. Anyone can still enter for free and have a chance!**

**Basic entry for the drawing will be type the designated command in chat during the stream. You can enter at any time during the 4 hour window, but to claim the prize you must be (1) present in chat, (2) a follower of the channel, (3) account must be 2 days old, and (4) not already have won a drawing. If these conditions are not met at the time of drawing, a re-roll will be done immediately until a winner is found. The individuals who win the additional codes will have a chance to choose between either the Sunstone or Doomcrow code they will receive.**


That should be all the important details. If you have any questions, feel free tweet me [@the_pengwin](https://twitter.com/the_pengwin) or catch me on stream!
