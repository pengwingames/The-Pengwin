### Beat Sekiro, next is some Division 2 grind and WoW Mythic+ grinding

The goal: 450+ gearscore cap and hit +20 keys by end of April!

Will I DO IT?!? Tune in and find out.  Maybe also some casual games somewhere in between.

 
  
   
   
### Path of Exile Synthesis league giveaway on ~~3/8/19~~ COMPLETED

*I've already run this by GGG support*

**Who am I? The Pengwin** [twitch.tv/the_pengwin](www.twitch.tv/the_pengwin), a small fly on the wall streamer who has been around games for his entire life. I only have about ~550 hours in path so I'd describe myself as a semi-hardcore-casual-enthusiast. Gaming is a passion and depending on the reception of this giveaway I may do this for future leagues to come! I plan to stream all sorts of games, so my content is not strictly PoE related. Feel free to shout out helpful tips or point out how terrible I am compared to your other favorite streamers!

That should be all the important details. If you have any questions, feel free tweet me [@the_pengwin](https://twitter.com/the_pengwin) or catch me on stream!
